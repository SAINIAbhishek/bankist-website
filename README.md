A website that demonstrate the Events and DOM manipulation using the JavaScript.

It's a course project. 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!' on the udemy. It provided me an opportunity to learn different concepts related to the events and dom like scrolling effects, lazy loading images building a slider and many more. It is only for learning process.

- Tabbed component  
- Sticky navigation - Intersection Observer API
- Scroll effect - Intersection Observer API
